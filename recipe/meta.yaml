  summary: Python NOAA Unit Converter for Oil Spills
  description: |
    Python NOAA Unit Converter for Oil Spills provides a python package for
    doing physical unit conversion. It includes the odd units (API gravity,
    etc) that are used for oil spill response and planning, but not the odd
    units that other fields may require.
    It also includes many common units for general use.
